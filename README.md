The assignment is to essentially recreate Facebook: users can post, comment, and send friend requests to other users. In order to get past the login page, a user must sign in or create an account. I use the Devise gem to handle the user authentication. It's also required to allow a user to sign up/log in with their actual Facebook account using OAuth.
