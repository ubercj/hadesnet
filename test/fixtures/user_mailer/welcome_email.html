<p>
  Hey there, Zagreus! I've got orders from the boss to take you on a one way trip to the underworld, so here we go.

  The only thing I hate more than waiting is making <i>other</i> people wait. So just click on <a href="https://hades-net.herokuapp.com">this link</a> for express delivery to your feed.

<p>
  Anyways, wish I could stay, but I've got places to be. Enjoy your eternal stay, and see you around!
</p>

<p>Later,</p>
